# Evergreen Skills for Software Developers
[![Codeship Status for romenrg/evergreen-skills-developers](https://app.codeship.com/projects/57d86950-fee3-0136-cc17-56b6e41314e7/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/322711)

This repository includes a list of "evergreen skills" that should serve as a fair assessment of skilled software developers / engineers.

The purpose of this work is to serve as an alternative resource for conducting hiring interviews of software developers / engineers. This document focuses on software development best practices, cross-framework principles and other portable skills; instead of the usual focus on trends and/or specific knowledge of short-lived frameworks, which tend to quickly become outdated and often don't reflect the real value software developers / engineers bring to the organization.

This repository is a derivative work of the following article: "[What Makes a Great Software Engineer](https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2018/12/29/what-makes-a-great-software-engineer)".

_This is a work in progress. Important knowledge might be missing, existing bullets can probably be improved and better grouping strategies could be found. For those reasons, any contributions (i.e. PRs) are welcome._ Please feel free to propose changes following [the contributing guideline](CONTRIBUTING.md).
